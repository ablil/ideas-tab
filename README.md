# ideastab -- The developer's home

Ideastab is the place where you can save your side projects ideas, and keep notes to yourself, when you have so much ideas and you keep forgetting them.
Ideastab allows you to save ideas, description, and related links you find useful and much more ...

# :thinking: why ?

The reason I build this project, is to help me keep track of idea that crosses my mind, it could by at the bus, at work or at a meeting ...
I find myself alwasy forgetting about them, especially when time comes where I have some free time and I want to take my keyboard and write some code.
Another reason for building this project, I wanted to learn React, at that time I have never used it before, so I guess this is the first project I made with React.
